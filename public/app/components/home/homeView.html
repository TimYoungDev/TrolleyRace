        <p class="lead">
            Last year I ran the Man Vs. Machine challenge in the Human Race in Fort Collins CO.  I finished 65th
            overall with a time of 23:50.  While this was a great time I was not fast enough to beat the trolley.

            As part of the attempt in 2015 I allowed my co-workers to bet on whether I'd be successful and to
            also share their reasoning behind my success or failure.  Here again is a way for my
            co-workers to place their bets and also share their wonderful reasoning behind their bet.
